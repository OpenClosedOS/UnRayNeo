Started working on the UnRayNeo project to install clean Android on RanNeo X2 AR glasses without Chinese spyware. User connected the glasses via scrcpy to view the screen. Discussed options for screen sharing capabilities through MCP (Model Context Protocol) for WindSurf to view the screen as well, but found no specific screen sharing MCP available. Successfully set up the Android MCP server to interact with the RanNeo X2 AR glasses, enabling screenshot capture, package listing, UI layout analysis, and ADB command execution directly from WindSurf. Accessed native settings and developer options on the glasses, confirming USB debugging is enabled by default. Encountered an issue when the magnetic cable was accidentally disconnected during an active session, requiring a device reset. Identified potential Chinese spyware packages and gathered system information to support the goal of installing clean Android on the glasses. Successfully captured and saved screenshots in an organized directory structure, and translated Chinese system messages including "Initializing... Please wait" which confirmed the presence of Chinese software that needs to be replaced. Implemented WiFi functionality for the RanNeo X2 AR glasses, enabling listing available networks, connecting to specific networks, and updating the MCP server configuration with the device's IP address.
